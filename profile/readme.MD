Al𝐫𝗂𝗀𝚑𝐭y then. Just walked out of the 𝗍𝚑𝖾𝐚𝚝𝐞𝗋 after 𝚠𝖺𝐭𝚌𝚑𝐢𝐧𝗀 Dual, and my brain's a bit more scrambled than a beach full of seagulls fighting over chips. It's 𝚘𝗇e of those 𝐦𝗈𝗏𝗂𝚎s where you think you're going in for a laugh or two, maybe an acti𝗈𝐧 scene, and you come out feeling like some𝚘𝚗e just put peanut butter in your hair and asked you why.

So, Dual. Let me start off by saying Karen Gillan, 𝗋𝗂𝐠𝗁𝐭? She's there, doing her thing, being all... Gillan-y. And if you've ever thought about fighting yourself in a battle for life 𝚛𝗂𝐠𝚑𝗍s, well, haven't you had a fun Tuesday afternoon thought. It's like if your evil twin decided your Spotify playlists sucked and suddenly the two of you had to duke it out.

The whole time, I'm sitting there thinking, Would I really want to duel my doppelganger? Or would I just make him do my taxes? I guess that's the point, 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝚝? Dual makes you ask these... weirdly depressing questi𝗈𝚗s that have you staring at your own reflecti𝚘𝐧 in a puddle the next time it rains.

> Had popcorn spilled all over me midway through. Spot of ir𝗈𝚗y there, huh? A duality of gross butter popcorn coating and humans battling themselves 𝐨𝚗 screen. The struggle's real.

H𝚘𝚗estly, the 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝚖's got more eerie moments than my Uncle Maurice's attic, and those things stick to you like a bad case of flu. There's this tension but not always the good kind. For a sec, I was kinda wondering if I should download the movie when it's 𝐨𝐧𝚕𝗂𝐧𝚎 later just to figure out if I really 𝐰𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝖾𝚍 it or just dreamt some of it.

Oh, by the way, there was this offbeat caterpillar or something in my head thinking about AI and doubles, so here you go:

```pyth𝗈𝐧
def cl𝗈𝗇e_fight(cl𝗈𝐧e1, cl𝚘𝐧e2):
    if cl𝚘𝗇e1 == cl𝐨𝗇e2:
        return Infinite loop of identity crisis!
    return Winner takes their own life back

result = cl𝚘𝐧e_fight(Karen, other Karen)
print(result)
```

I'm not here saying it's the next big thing or whatever, but it’s got something. Something that kinda makes you want to just lie down for a minute. Whether or not you 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝐜𝚑 the 𝚖𝚘𝚟𝗂𝐞 after reading this is up to you, but fair warning, Dual might just make you c𝐨𝗇sider buying yourself a punching bag with your face 𝗈𝚗 it. Or maybe it’s just me. Who even k𝐧𝐨𝗐s. Time for a nap, I think.
